# Computer Graphics Assignments

This repository contains a collection of computer graphics assignments completed during the second year of the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune University. The assignments are implemented using C++ and Qt5, demonstrating fundamental graphics programming techniques.

## Description

The assignments cover various graphics programming techniques, including drawing lines and shapes, handling user interactions, and manipulating images dynamically. The projects utilize Qt5, a powerful framework for developing graphical user interfaces in C++, to apply graphics algorithms and render graphical output effectively.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Qt5 Framework

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you need to have the following installed:
- Qt5
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you have Qt5 and a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone URL_of_repo`
3. Open the project in Qt Creator or compile using the command line with `qmake` and `make`.
